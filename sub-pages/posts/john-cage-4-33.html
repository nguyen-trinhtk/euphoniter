            <p><i>“Hey, what’s your favorite song?”</i></p>

<p>If anyone ever comes to you and asks this, you will probably have some names in mind. And if they ask you to elaborate, you might say you love that song because of its catchy melody, or because of its complexity in harmony. These are the most obvious and straightforward reasons for loving a certain song, right? I mean, the most basic quality of a song or musical piece is sound, right?</p>
<img src="../../images/image6.jpg" alt="">
<p>Well, let me introduce to you the most fascinating song I’ve ever known. Before I say anything more, let’s listen to it right now.</p>

<p>Well, don’t click that reload (or F5) button immediately. Don’t try to fix your speaker or headphones too. There is nothing wrong with the image or audio. You are actually hearing <i>it</i>! You are actually seeing <i>it</i>. You are feeling <i>nothing</i>, which is actually a thing. </p>

<p>This may sound like a joke, but it is actually a real song and is even performed by orchestras. The song I show here is called “ 4’33’’ ”, written by composer John Cage. When performing, musicians will still go and pick up their instrument, get in play position, and then stay silent for exactly 4 minutes and 33 seconds - the meaning of the title. After finishing the performance, the audience will applaud - as usual. This song, as a result of its remarkable characteristics, can be played on any instrument. </p>

<p>The idea for the song came to John when he was writing his <i>Sonatas and Interludes</i> in 1947. He believed that “any auditory experience may constitute music”. He wanted people to listen to random noises - the rustle of winds, the light tap on the piano, or the sound of moving chairs - while appreciating the silence - a moment to stop and think. When it first premiered, the song was thought to be a mistake, but it came out otherwise. John Cage later stated that the audience missed many accidental sounds - his aim for performing the song -  because they were focusing on the “mistake”.</p>

<p>Later on, many musicians regarded this special musical piece as a creative and outstanding composition. Psychologists would use it for social experiments. Even in popular culture, many turned 4’33” into a prank and meme. This song, therefore, reached a wider audience and is arguably John Cage’s best-known work.</p>
