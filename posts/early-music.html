            </div>
    
            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>You may have heard of Mozart or Beethoven, the well-known composers of the Classical era. But have you ever wondered, for example, what music sounded like before the birth of this musical period? If yes, this article will be your answer.</p><br>

<p>Music has been there for a very long time. In fact, ever since humans were only able to harvest crops with stone tools, they had known how to make music. Before the existence of Classical music, there were three main periods: Prehistoric, Ancient, and Middle Ages music, which aligns with remarkable historical events.</p><br>

<p>The first musical pieces were created about 40 thousand years ago - far before the rise of civilizations - and this period is called <i>Prehistoric</i>. Many pieces of tools made from bones and stones that can make melodic sounds were excavated from various Paleolithic archaeology sites, which may be evidence of the earliest musical instrument. Examples of those include the 40,000-year-old Divje Babe flute made from bear femur and the stringed Ravanahatha found near nowadays India. Although we did not have any record of what their music sounded like back then, it is reasonable that prehistoric people knew how to create it and use it in certain circumstances.</p><br>

<p>During the Ancient period, people started society and large-scale agriculture. This is when civilizations, such as Egypt or Mesopotamia, appeared. Music, therefore, gained popularity: it serves as prayer, celebrations, and worship. This era also witnessed the invention of musical notation. As researchers observed, music from this period tended to be monophony - melody without accompanied harmony - and forms of oral music, such as hymns, were widespread. Famous poems like Illiad and Oddysey were read melodically to make music, showing the dominance of texts in musical settings.</p><br>

</p><br>And that was the Ancient period. Fast forward to the Middle Ages (or Medieval) period. During the Middle Ages, music played a significant role in the cultural and social fabric of society. Aligned with the historical context, music was primarily influenced by the Christian Church, serving as an integral part of religious ceremonies and liturgical practices. Gregorian chant, a monophonic vocal style, dominated the early medieval period, characterized by its serene and contemplative melodies. As the Middle Ages progressed, polyphonic compositions emerged, showing multiple melodic lines harmonizing. Notable composers of the time include Hildegard von Bingen, Guillaume de Machaut, and Leonin.</p><br>

<p>You have walked through the first major stages of music: prehistoric, ancient, and medieval. Hopefully, you have learned more about the early period of music through this article. And remember, if you want to know about the later periods, please stay tuned for the next posts.</p><br>
